    <h1>Everything I Know About Competitive Pokemon</h1>
        <h2>Smogon vs VGC</h3>
        <p>Their are two different versions of<br>
            competitive Pokemon. Smogon, which is the fanmade singles version.<br>
            And VGC(Virtual Game Championship), which is the<br>
            official doubles version. I mostly play VGC but if I<br>
            ever get bored of it I switch to Smogon. Because I norrmally play VGC<br>
            I will be covering more in depth with VGC.</p>

        <h2>Where I play</h3>
        <p>You might assume that most people play competitive Pokemon on their switches<br>
        , but most people play Pokemon on their mobile devices! Thanks to a <br>
        website known as <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/" target="_blank">Pokemon Showdown!</a> It is a battle simulator<br> 
        that is very game accurate. Pokemon Showdown was meant for Smogon, but<br>
        also supports VGC.

        <h3>Vocab</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Restricted Legendary: Super powerful mons that are norrmally not legal, but when they are you can only use one or two.</li>
            <li>Sub-Legendary: Available in quite a few rulesets. These are all the legendaries that are not restricted.</li>
            <li>Mythical: Just memorize which mons are legendary and which are mythical. Mythical Pokemon are almost never legal.</li>
            <li>Paradox Pokemon: Pokemon that are past and future forms are preexisting Pokemon such as Flutter Mane(Misdreavus) Iron Hands(Hariyama). They are norrmally quite strong</li>
        </ul>

    <div id="Smogon Tiers">
        <h2>Smogon Tiers</h2>
        <p>
            Smogon is divided in many different tiers based<br>
            on how often a Pokemon is used and how powerful<br>
            it is. When you are playing in a specific tier you<br>
            can use the Pokemon in the tier you are playing in<br>
            , and the Pokemon in the tiers below it. For example<br>
            If you are playing in the OU tier you can use anything below OU and in OU<br>
            The tiers will be listed below in order along with<br>
            a short description of what each means.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Anything Goes(also called AG), Insanely broken, breaks the other tiers(including Ubers!) in a bad way.</li>
            <li>Ubers, most strong legendaries go here, but being a legendary does not auto qualify for this. Some insanely broken normal mons go here.</li>
            <li>OU(OverUsed), Most strong normal mons go here</li>
            <li>UU(UnderUsed), A lot of these mons are still strong and relevent in OU, but are a bit weaker</li>
            <li>RU(RarelyUsed), Still a bit weaker but rarely seen in OU</li>
            <li>NU(NeverUsed), Very few are ever seen in OU</li>
            <li class="stinky">PU(It stinks), Almost never seen</li><!--Make this that greenish brown color when you get to adding CSS-->
            <li>ZU(ZeroUsage), Self-Expanatory</li>
        </ol>
        <aside>
            <p>BTW there are also "in-between" tiers(e.g., UUBL(UU Banlist) being too strong for UU but too weak for OU)<br>
            I didnt mention them because they arent very relevent and wont come up very often.</p>
        </aside>

    </div>

    <div id="meta">
        <h2>Da Meta(VGC)</h2>
        <p>Because I started playing during reg H and continued into reg i<br>
        My understanding of the Meta for the other rulesets is quite limited<br>
        , so I wont be talking about them.</p>
        <h3>Reg H</h3>
        <p>I really enjoy regulation h because all the legendary and paradox Pokemon are banned.<br>
        This really lowers the bar of what it means to be a powerful mon. The best Pokemon in this format was<br>
        probably Sneasler. But other mons like Rillaboom(damage and suppport), Indeedee(support), Armarouge(damage), Torkoal(ERUPTION), Ursaluna(Damage), and Amoongus(support) were also quite good.<br>
        Listed below is also one of the teams that I used for reg h.

            <p>I was really proud of this team, because I had just started playing and this was one of my better teams.</p>
