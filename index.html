            <h2>Smogon vs VGC</h3>
            <p>Their are two different versions of<br>
                competitive Pokemon. Smogon, which is the fanmade singles version.<br>
                And VGC(Virtual Game Championship), which is the<br>
                official doubles version. I mostly play VGC but if I<br>
                ever get bored of it I switch to Smogon. Because I norrmally play VGC<br>
                I will be going more in depth with VGC.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Where_I_Play">
            <h2>Where I play</h3>
            <p>You might assume that most people play competitive Pokemon on their switches<br>
            , but most people play Pokemon on their mobile devices! Thanks to a <br>
            website known as <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/" target="_blank">Pokemon Showdown!</a> It is a battle simulator<br> 
            that is very game accurate. Pokemon Showdown was meant for Smogon, but<br>
            also supports VGC.

            <h3>Vocab</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Restricted Legendary: Super powerful mons that are norrmally not legal, but when they are you can only use one or two.</li>
                <li>Sub-Legendary: Available in quite a few rulesets. These are all the legendaries that are not restricted.</li>
                <li>Mythical: Just memorize which mons are legendary and which are mythical. Mythical Pokemon are almost never legal.</li>
                <li>Paradox Pokemon: Pokemon that are past and future forms are preexisting Pokemon such as Flutter Mane(Misdreavus) Iron Hands(Hariyama). They are norrmally quite strong</li>

                The rulesets for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet<br>

            <h2>Smogon Tiers</h2>
            <p>
                Smogon is divided in many different tiers based<br>
                on how often a Pokemon is used and how powerful<br>
                it is. When you are playing in a specific tier you<br>
                can use the Pokemon in the tier you are playing in<br>
                , and the Pokemon in the tiers below it. For example<br>
                If you are playing in the OU tier you can use anything below OU and in OU<br>
                The tiers will be listed below in order along with<br>
                a short description of what each means.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Anything Goes(also called AG), Insanely broken, breaks the other tiers(including Ubers!) in a bad way.</li>
                <li>Ubers, most strong legendaries go here, but being a legendary does not auto qualify for this. Some insanely broken normal mons go here.</li>
                <li>OU(OverUsed), Most strong normal mons go here</li>
                <li>UU(UnderUsed), A lot of these mons are still strong and relevent in OU, but are a bit weaker</li>
                <li>RU(RarelyUsed), Still a bit weaker but rarely seen in OU</li>
                <li>NU(NeverUsed), Very few are ever seen in OU</li>
                <li class="stinky">PU(It stinks), Almost never seen</li>
                <li>ZU(ZeroUsage), Self-Expanatory</li>
            </ol>
            <aside>
                <p>BTW there are also "in-between" tiers(e.g., UUBL(UU Banlist) being too strong for UU but too weak for OU)<br>
                I didnt mention them because they arent very relevent and wont come up very often.</p>
            </aside>

        <div id="Meta">
            <h2>Da Meta(VGC)</h2>
            <p>Because I started playing during reg H and continued into reg i<br>
            My understanding of the Meta for the other rulesets is quite limited<br>
            , so I wont be talking about them.</p>
            <h3>Reg H</h3>
            <p>I really enjoy regulation h because all the legendary and paradox Pokemon are banned.<br>
            This really lowers the bar of what it means to be a powerful mon. The best Pokemon in this format was<br>
            probably Sneasler. But other mons like Rillaboom(damage and suppport), Indeedee(support), Armarouge(damage), Torkoal(ERUPTION), Ursaluna(Damage), and Amoongus(support) were also quite good.<br>
            Listed below is also one of the teams that I used for reg h.
            </p>

            <p>I was really proud of this team, because I had just started playing and this was one of my better teams(I made a lot of not so "better" teams).</p>
            <h3>Reg G</h3>
            <p>This meta was bit overwhelming for me  because this was the first time that I had actually<br>
               seen and used restricted ledgendaries. I eventually adapted and made a really good team(in my opinion)<br>
               I will feature two Pokemon for reg g(one restricted and one normal). The best restricted Pokemon is probably<br>
               Miraidon, and the best non restricted is probably Urshifu Rapid-Strike.
            </p>

            <aside>
            <p>Even though Urshifu Single-Strike is not as popular it is still quite good as a glass cannon.</p>
            </aside>
            <p>The teams I would like to feature is one of my(in my opinion) greatest creations.<br>
                It is quite consistent and well rounded. Brought me from around 1000 elo to around 1100 elo.</p>

            <a href="RegGExample.html" target="_blank"><h4 id="blue">Here is an example of the team in action.</h4></a>
            <h3>Reg I</h3>
            <p>The power level is even higher now with you being able to use TWO restricted Pokemon.<br>
            I would say the best Pokemon is around the same with Miraidon and Urshifu Rapid-Strike being<br>
            the best.</p>

            <h3>Incineroar</h3>
            <p>There is one Pokemon that I have not mentioned. Its Incineroar,<br>
            you might not think that its that good but if you look at its supporting<br>
            options then you will find where you find where its power lies.</p>
