    <h1>Everything I Know About Competitive Pokemon</h1>
        <h2>Smogon vs VGC</h3>
        <p>Their are two different versions of<br>
            competitive Pokemon. Smogon, which is the fanmade singles version.<br>
            And VGC(Virtual Game Championship), which is the<br>
            official doubles version. I mostly play VGC but if I<br>
            ever get bored of it I switch to Smogon. Because I norrmally play VGC<br>
            I will be covering more in depth with VGC.</p>

        <h2>Where I play</h3>
        <p>You might assume that most people play competitive Pokemon on their switches<br>
        ,but most people play Pokemon on their mobile devices! Thanks to a <br>
        website known as <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/" target="_blank">Pokemon Showdown!</a>It is a battle simulator<br> 
        that is very game accurate. Pokemon Showdown was meant for Smogon, but<br>
        also supports VGC.

        <h2>VGC Rulesets</h2>
        <p>
            VGC changes rulesets every once in a while.<br><!--add what a restricted means and sub-legend means add descriptions to each reg-->
            The rulesets for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet<br>
            are listed below in order of that they were<br>
            used with a link to a website that talks<br>
            about the rules for each. Some knowledge to know<br>
            before looking at the rules is what a sub legendary,<br>
            restricted legendary, mythical, and paradox pokemon is.<br>
            Restricted Legendary: These are some of the most powerful Pokemon of all time. Norrmally found on the box art of each game. Norrmally not legal but when legal you are only allowed one or two.
            Sub Legendary: Any legendary that is not restricted. Allowed in quite a few rulesets<br>
            Mythical: Im not really sure what the difference between legendary and mythical is, but all you need to know is that they are almost never legal.<br>
            Paradox Pokemon: They are past and future forms of preexising Pokemon, many of them are quite strong are legal most of the time.

    <div id="Smogon Tiers">
        <h2>Smogon Tiers</h2>
        <p>
            Smogon is divided in many different tiers based<br>
            on how often a Pokemon is used and how powerful<br>
            it is. When you are playing in a specific tier you<br>
            can use the Pokemon in the tier you are playing in<br>
            , and the Pokemon in the tiers below it. For example<br>
            If you are playing in the OU tier you can use anything below OU and in OU<br>
            The tiers will be listed below in order along with<br>
            a short description of what each means.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Anything Goes(also called AG), Insanely broken, breaks the other tiers(including Ubers!) in a bad way.</li>
            <li>Ubers, most strong legendaries go here, but being a legendary does not auto qualify for this. Some insanely broken normal mons go here.</li>
            <li>OU(OverUsed), Most strong normal mons go here</li>
            <li>UU(UnderUsed), A lot of these mons are still strong and relevent in OU, but are a bit weaker</li>
            <li>RU(RarelyUsed), Still a bit weaker but rarely seen in OU</li>
            <li>NU(NeverUsed), Very few are ever seen in OU</li>
            <li class="stinky">PU(It stinks), Almost never seen</li><!--Make this that greenish brown color when you get to adding CSS-->
            <li>ZU(ZeroUsage), Self-Expanatory</li>
        </ol>
        <aside>
            <p>BTW there are also "in-between" tiers(e.g., UUBL(UU Banlist) being too strong for UU but too weak for OU)<br>
            I didnt mention them because they arent very relevent and wont come up very often.</p>
