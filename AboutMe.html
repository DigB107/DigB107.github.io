    <p>My name is Daniel Tang, and I enjoy playing competetive Pokemon<br>
        and coding(obviously cause I made this website). I started playing Pokemon<br>
        after my someone in my school found out how to emulate Game Boy Advance<br>
        games on the school ipads. You know what the first thing I did with this knowledge was?<br>
        I did a playthrough of Pokemon FireRed. This was my first ever non spin-off<br>
        Pokemon game, and I really enjoyed it. I started watching Pokemon videos<br>
        and I found a Youtuber named Wolfe Glick. He was really good at VGC(like more tournament wins than anyone else).<br>
        I watched some of his videos and I got interested in competetive Pokemon. I learned<br>
        through experience and found my newest hobby.</p>
